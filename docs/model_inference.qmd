# Model Inference

The `model_inference` pipeline is designed to handle the final stage of inference. It currently includes a single placeholder node for **predicting outputs**, which you can customize to implement your model-specific inference logic.

---

## Key Features

- **Placeholder Node**: The pipeline includes a template node for predictions. This ensures a simple starting point for implementing your inference workflow.
- **Customizable**: You can add additional nodes or modify the existing one to include preprocessing, postprocessing, or any additional operations required for inference.

---

## Implementation Tips

1. **Add Batch Processing**  
   If your inference involves multiple inputs, consider implementing batch processing to optimize performance.

---

## Next Steps

To complete the inference pipeline:
1. Replace the placeholder node with your model-specific prediction logic.
2. Integrate the `model_inference` pipeline with the `inf_data_preprocessing` pipeline to create a seamless end-to-end workflow.
