title: Automatic Documentation Generation
# order: 
---

This pod leverages **quartodoc** and **quarto** to generate documentation directly from the codebase. This ensures seamless integration of documentation with the code and keeps it consistently up-to-date.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Install Quarto**  
   Ensure you have Quarto installed by following the instructions [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

2. **Configure Quartodoc**  
   Quartodoc extracts docstrings from Python code and generates markdown files for documentation.

---

## Steps to Enable Automatic Documentation

1. **Expose Functions or Classes for Quartodoc**  
   - Add functions or classes with docstrings to the `__all__` list in the package's `__init__.py` file.  
   - For example, in the [`__init__.py`](../src/image_ml_pod/__init__.py) file:

     ```python
     __all__ = ["function_name", "ClassName"]
     ```

2. **Include in Reference Documentation**  
   - Update the `_quarto.yml` file at the project root to include the new items in the `quartodoc` configuration.  
   - Under the `sections` key, specify the items you want in the reference documentation.

3. **Pre-commit Hook for Auto-generation**  
   - The `.pre_commit_config.yaml` file includes a hook that auto-generates documentation files before each commit. This ensures your documentation reflects the latest codebase.

## Manually Generating Documentation

To manually generate the documentation, run:

```bash
quartodoc build
```

The generated markdown files will be located in the `reference` folder at the project root.

---

## Viewing Documentation

1. **View as Markdown**  
   Navigate to the `reference` folder and open the generated markdown files.

2. **View as a Website**  
   Launch a local preview server by running:

   ```bash
   quarto preview
   ```

   This opens the documentation in a browser as a website.
